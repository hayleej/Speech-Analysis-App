## Acknowledgements
[Charsiu](https://github.com/lingjzhu/charsiu/) is used in the program for the forced alignment and phoneme segmentation of audio. It has been modified slightly for smoother connection to the rest of the program but everything contained in the [charsiu directory](charsiu/) is the work of Jian Zhu and Cong Zhang.
